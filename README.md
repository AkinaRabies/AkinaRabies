# Hello, I'm Lu√≠sa!

I am brazilian but I also speak english!

My currently passion is C language and I also crave for learning assembly language. It may look hard and I have concentration problems such as ADHD, also I have autism, but nothing is impossible. As I believe that the sky is not the limit, but unlimited, as we have such a big universe full of possibilities.

Here I will put my tragetory in learning. I'm in the sixth period of university in computer science and I plan to make a second graduation in something related to biological science or aviation. 
When I graduate completely, I want to work in cybersecurity or as a software engineer for public services here in my country.

Don't be afraid to use my codes. They're open source, of course. You can use them to learn together with me and if there's something wrong, please, send me feedback.

## Things i'm learning for now
